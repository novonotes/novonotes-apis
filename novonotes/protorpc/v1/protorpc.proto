// ProtoRPC v1 - Protocol Specification
//
// This file defines the ProtoRPC protocol, a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol.
// While inspired by the JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification as a design reference, ProtoRPC
// uses Protocol Buffers binary format for efficient data encoding and transport.
//
// The primary goal is to provide a language-agnostic, efficient, and strictly-typed
// RPC framework that leverages the performance advantages of Protocol Buffers.
//
// For 'params' and 'result', this protocol uses bytes fields to maintain the
// efficiency of Protocol Buffers while allowing flexible payload encoding.
// The 'id' field uses string for simplicity and compatibility.
//
// The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
// "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in these comments are to
// be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
//
// JSON-RPC specification: https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification

// ===================================================================
// 1. Request Object
// ===================================================================
//
// A Request object represents a single RPC call. It is sent from a Client to a Server.
// Every Request MUST include an `id` and expects a Response object.
message Request {
  // A String specifying the version of the RPC protocol.
  // This MUST be exactly "1.0" to adhere to the base specification.
  string rpc_version = 1;

  // A String containing the name of the method to be invoked.
  //
  // Method names SHOULD follow the format: /<package>.<service>/<method>
  // For example: "/novonotes.audio_engine.v1alpha1.DeviceInstanceService/GetDeviceInstance"
  string method = 2;

  // Serialized parameter values for the method call.
  // This member MAY be omitted. If present, it contains the method parameters
  // encoded as Protocol Buffers binary data.
  //
  // The exact format and structure of the encoded parameters is defined by
  // the specific method being called and should be documented in the service
  // definition.
  bytes params = 3;

  // An identifier established by the Client that MUST be included in every Request.
  // The Server's Response MUST contain the same value.
  // This is used to correlate Requests with Responses.
  //
  // For responses to invalid requests where the id cannot be determined,
  // an empty string ("") is used.
  string id = 4;
}

// ===================================================================
// 2. Response Object
// ===================================================================
//
// A Response object is sent from the Server to the Client in reply to every Request.
message Response {
  // A String specifying the version of the RPC protocol.
  // This MUST be exactly "1.0".
  string rpc_version = 1;

  // A Response object MUST contain either a `result` or an `error` member, but
  // MUST NOT contain both. This is enforced by the `oneof` construct.
  oneof result_or_error {
    // This member is REQUIRED on success.
    // It MUST NOT exist if there was an error invoking the method.
    // Contains the method's return value encoded as Protocol Buffers binary data.
    // The exact format is determined by the method that was invoked.
    bytes result = 2;

    // This member is REQUIRED on error.
    // It MUST NOT exist if there was no error.
    // Uses the standard google.rpc.Status for error representation.
    google.rpc.Status error = 3;
  }

  // This member is REQUIRED for every Response.
  // It MUST be the same value as the `id` in the corresponding Request object.
  //
  // If there was an error in detecting the `id` in the Request
  // (e.g., a Parse Error or an Invalid Request), this `id` MUST be an empty string ("").
  string id = 4;
}

// ===================================================================
// 3. Batch Calls
// ===================================================================
//
// To send several Request objects at once, the Client MAY send a `BatchRequest`.
// The Server MAY process a batch rpc call as a set of concurrent tasks,
// processing them in any order and with any width of parallelism.
message BatchRequest {
  // A list of `Request` objects to be processed by the server.
  // If the list is empty, the server MUST return a BatchResponse containing
  // a single Response with an "Invalid Request" error.
  repeated Request requests = 1;
}

// The Server's response to a `BatchRequest`.
message BatchResponse {
  // A list of `Response` objects corresponding to the `Request` objects in the
  // `BatchRequest`.
  //
  // - There MUST be a `Response` for every `Request` in the batch.
  // - The Server MAY process the batch of requests concurrently and in any order.
  // - The Response objects MAY be returned in any order within the list.
  // - The Client MUST use the `id` field to correlate responses with their requests.
  //
  // Note: The Server MUST always reply with a `BatchResponse` for a `BatchRequest`,
  // even if the batch is empty or contains invalid requests. In such cases, the
  // `BatchResponse` will contain appropriate error responses.
  repeated Response responses = 1;
